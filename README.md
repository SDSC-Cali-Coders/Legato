## Workflow for our team
If you are working on a new feature, create a new branch with a specified name and do the following:
Work and add/commit/push to that local branch
If you are working with someone on the same branch and want to update the remote branch, you need to first pull to make sure your code is up to date. Then push to that remote repository
> git push -u origin [BRANCH NAME]

If you are working on an existing feature and want to work on an existing branch, checkout that remtoe branch and pull to start working on it

If you are done with your feature (including testing if applicable), then you can submit a merge request from your feature branch to main
