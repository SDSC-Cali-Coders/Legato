# React-based FrontEnd

For our front end we will be using React to organize our pages into reusable components and using the Bootstrap framework for styling.

File hierarchy is organized like so:

```
\: root hosts files for repo & node package management 
| public: hosts manifest.json, index.html, and all assets
| src: 
|\
| | components: 
|
```
