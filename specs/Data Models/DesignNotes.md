# Design Notes

## Overview

Goal of this file is clarify 
- WHAT data we're storing in our database
- HOW it's organized

**What**: Our app will be using MongoDB to store data that our app relies on to function. MongoDB stores data as `documents`, which are essentially `JSON` objects - they consisten of a set of `field`:`value` pairs (in that format!). All documents have a unique `_id` field that can be specified to any type but is randomly generated by default.

**How**: The `document types` and the structure of these `document types` used by our database will be detailed in this file.

## Layout

General Layout will be as follows
- Data Models (Version number)
  - Document Type 1 (Version number)
  - Document Type 2 (Version number)
  - Document Type 3 (Version number)
  - ... 

This file will incorporate `versioning` starting with Version 0.0

There will be a `Major version` (e.g. 0.X, 1.X, 2.X) that will be updated when `Data Models` is updated by either introducing a new document type or removing a document type (e.g. introducing a "Track" document type). Any differences introduced by a new `Major version` will be briefed under the section title. 

There will be a `minor version` (e.g. X.1, X.2, X.3) that will be updated when the fields of a document type are modified (e.g. "Track" document type introduces a field named "Album").

Newer `Major versions` will be pushed from the top of the document, therefor you will see the most recent version of the data models while also having access to prior versions if you're working on features that rely on older versions (ensures compatilibity and overall usefulness of this file). As an example you will see `Data Models V.2`, then `Data Models V.1`, and finally `Data Models V.0`.

Newer `minor versions` will be pushed from the top of each `Major version` section, this will similarly allow you to see the most recent version of each document type while also having access to all iterations/versions of the data model. An example sequence you might see would be: 
- `Version 0`
    - `User 0.0` 
    - `Artist 0.2`
    - `Artist 0.1` 
    - `Artist 0.0` 
    - `Event 0.0`

## Data Models Version 0

Initial set of data models based off the info we decided on during Brainstorming/Stories.

The 3 main document types decided upon during then were Users (for maintining user-related info), Artists, and Events (using the BandsInTown API to update with relevant info for our app)

### User 0.0
- `version: 0.0`
- `profileData: TBD`
- `linkedSocials: TBD`
- `friends: [User IDs]`
- `interestedEvents: [Event IDs]`
- `goingEvents: [Event IDs]`
- `subscribedArtists: [Artist IDs]`
- `isPrivateAccount: Boolean`
- `outGoingFriendRequests: [User IDs]`
- `inComingfriendRequests: [User IDs]`

### Artist 0.0
- `version: 0.0`
- `name: String`
- `upcomingEvents: [Event IDs]`
- `subscribedUsers: [User IDs]`

### Event 0.0
- `version: 0.0`
- `associatedArtists: [Artist IDs]`
- `locationDetails: TBD`
- `interestedUsers: [User IDs]`
- `goingUsers: [User IDs]`
